# Odin-landing-page Project!

The website is quite similar to the one on the picture, used the reference from the image but certain weights on fonts are not quite right.
The site is awfully non-responsive but it was not the objective of this lesson.
I'm still not sure when to use fixed widths or heights (because of responsiveness, but I assume later lessons will help with that)
The flex shorthand attribute is quite hard to master, I need more practice!

Last but not the least, I'm still triying to improve my commit messages. They kinda suck...

Regarding the website:
I recommend using the placeholder web that is in the index.html file in the img references, it makes everything so much easier.
I divided every section by divs and worked them alone.

--- The header ---
You can user de first layout exercise as a reference. It's pretty straightforward since is pretty much the same but using space-evenly attribute.

--- Section 01 ---
Section 1 was a PIA. I can't even comment how I did it (I'm sorry, I should be better on passing knowledge but I still suck as this). But got it quite similar!

--- Section 02 ---
As the header, you can use the "information" (the one about plants) exercise as a reference, it's pretty much the same. Copy, paste and a bit of tweaking (quite a bit).

--- Section 03 ---
Really easy, it's just text and flexbox! This is one of the sections that the fonts don't look quite right (even though I used the reference attributes).

--- Section 04 ---
It's like a really easy version of section 01 since it has less elements and no images. It's a matter of using flexbox and that's that.

--- Footer ---
The most easy part, center and center and you are done!


Farewell words:

Hope I got you to laugh a bit with my commits and this readme file. It's at least something! (since the web is not the best).
But one trick I learned is that the inspector is your best friend! Also, user border (I user 1px solid red with a universal selector) for divs when you are creating the skeleton, it's easier to see what you are doing that way! Then you can erase it
